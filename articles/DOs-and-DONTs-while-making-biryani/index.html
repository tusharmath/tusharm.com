          <section class="content"><p>I tried to copy a lot of biryani recipes that are on the internet and in that process I wasted a lot of meat and&nbsp;rice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‘s all about the proportions ultimately so don’t take it&nbsp;casually</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took a lot of perseverance in getting the recipe just right. So here are some DOs and <span class="caps">DON</span>&#39;Ts for making  mutton dum biryani (<em>same applies for chicken biryani</em>). These points are an extension of the Hyderabadi style biryani which is cooked in layers of meat and&nbsp;rice.</p>
<h1>DOs</h1>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you use a thick base vessel for cooking so that the heat gets evenly&nbsp;distributed.</li>
<li>Best practice is to marinate the meat for 2-3 hours so that all the juices get inside the&nbsp;meat.</li>
<li>Use lots of fried onions in the&nbsp;marinade.</li>
<li>Add good amount of salt. Generally the salt concentration reduces after you add the meat so make sure you have incorporated that in your&nbsp;calculation.</li>
<li>Add good amount of spices, it is possible that the marinade seems spicy at first but trust me on this, after you add the meat the spiciness will decrease&nbsp;considerably.</li>
<li>Cook the meat at the lowest flame that is possible in your kitchen. Low heat helps in uniform&nbsp;cooking.</li>
<li>Add good amounts of <span class="caps">GHEE</span> (<em>clarified butter</em>) in the&nbsp;marinade.</li>
<li>The rice used should be of high quality&nbsp;basmati.</li>
<li>Seal the vessel so that the heat doesn&#39;t&nbsp;escape.</li>
</ol>
<h1><span class="caps">DON</span>&#39;Ts</h1>
<ol>
<li>Don‘t use too much of curd, it makes the meat bland and tasteless. It only helps in cooking, it does’t add any taste to the&nbsp;biryani.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t give direct heat to the meat, put the vessel over a pan or some other metal layer (<em>Heat should be transferred to the vessel through conduction and not convection</em>). It takes time to cook, mutton might take upto 1:45 hrs to cook and chicken can take upto 1:15 hrs. So have&nbsp;patience.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t add raw onions in the marinade, it will not taste&nbsp;good.</li>
</ol>

<p>About this blog - It is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. So you should be expecting psychological, social, philosophical and some scientific conversations. Occasionally I may post some technical information.
