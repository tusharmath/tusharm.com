<h2 id="-challenges">🥴 Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>More often than not, people of different levels of skills <span class="amp">&amp;</span> experiences contribute to the same code<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>base.</li>
<li>There is an explicit hierarchy within the team (captain, manager etc.) that can influence the review<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>process.</li>
<li>Very often you are working with folks who are trying to meet an external deadline on a project that has not yet found a product-market<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>fit.</li>
<li>Some projects are green-field, so there is less structure both in terms of code and organization. Setting up standards too soon might turn out to be counter<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>productive.</li>
<li>Similarly some projects are huge, monolithic legacy systems with teams that are used to certain kinds of processes and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>setup.</li>
<li>You need to collaborate with stake holders in other teams viz Product, Design, <span class="caps">QA</span>,<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To have an effective code review setup, you need to incorporate these concerns for your team and organization. There will be things that work really well for some projects but fail miserably for others, <strong>context is key<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>here</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s not all that bad when it comes to code reviews, there are quite a few benefits of working in an organization also,<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>viz.</p>
<h2 id="-benefits">💃 Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>For starters, most of the developers are working on the same floor, in the same time zone. This is a massive collaboration booster, as there is less time spent in writing one-time-read documentations, articulating your arguments or waiting for someone to respond to your<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>queries.</li>
<li>The folks you are working with are not contributors who are “donating” their time to your project. They are engineers who are committed to work with you to achieve a common goal long<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>term.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="having-effective-code-reviews">Having Effective Code<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Reviews</h1>
<h2 id="-setup-a-culture">😇 Setup a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Culture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Code reviews should be looked at, as a part of your <strong>engineering culture</strong> rather than a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>process.</li>
<li>Developers should feel <strong>safe</strong> to communicate their opinions, whether they agree or disagree with<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>something.</li>
<li>Some people that you collaborate with might be new to the project or technology. For them, code reviews should be centered around making them learn and onboard<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>faster.</li>
<li>Encourage people in their initial reviews. Sending a <strong>congratulatory note</strong> publicly, on someone’s first <span class="caps">PR</span> getting merged or for some long stuck <span class="caps">PR</span>, really<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>helps!</li>
<li>It’s not just this one <span class="caps">PR</span> that needs your review, there are going to be many more across multiple projects. Encourage building a healthy rapport within your<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>team.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-have-effective-communication">🗣 Have Effective<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Communication</h2>
<ul>
<li>Derogatory or offensive feedback should be<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>flagged.</li>
<li>Nitpicking should be marked explicitly, use <strong>#nitpick</strong> if you want to be extra<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>clear.</li>
<li>Review feedback should emphasize on facts instead of feelings and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>opinions.</li>
<li>Exploit the fact that the developers are on the same floor. Block your calendar and have a face to face discussion instead of doing it over tools (Github, Gitlab<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-empower-the-team">💪 Empower the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Team</h2>
<ul>
<li>Let the team that’s actually working on the project decide the guidelines and processes for<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>themselves.</li>
<li>Hierarchical reviews (eg. captain reviewing her team) should be avoided as much as possible, they have a negative impact on the overall engineering<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>culture.</li>
<li>All reviews should be preferably done within your team and amongst<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>peers.</li>
<li>There should be minimum dependencies between teams for pull request<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>approvals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-have-a-developer-guideline">📝 Have a Developer<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Guideline</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t have it, create one! They are the most effective way of improving code review<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>efficiency.</li>
<li>Investing time in it, reviewing it frequently, and making it a part of the onboarding process saves a lot of time<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>later.</li>
<li>It’s sometimes better to have a coding guidelines that is easier maintain because of already available<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>tooling.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-create-domain-owners">👮‍♀️ Create Domain<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Owners</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create specific owners for certain parts of your<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>software.</li>
<li>Owners’ approval should be necessary for any changes made to those<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>pieces.</li>
<li>Don’t have only one owner for anything<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>😓</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-separate-subjective-from-objective-feedback">🤷‍♀️ Separate Subjective from Objective<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Feedback</h2>
<ul>
<li>There should be a very clear distinction between Objective and Subjective feedback while sharing it with the contributor. Use tags such as <strong>#<span class="caps">IMO</span></strong> ie. “In my opinion”, or <strong>#<span class="caps">IMHO</span></strong> ie “In my humble<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>opinion”</li>
<li>Objective feedback is the one that has been agreed upon as a group. It is in adherence to the project’s contribution guidelines. It flags — logical deficiencies, performance issues, high maintenance or reliability costs. It should remain <strong>non-negotiable</strong>.</li>
<li>Subjective feedback is an opinionated way of doing something. This should not be mandated even if it’s given by the domain owner or your<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>captain.</li>
<li>This distinction can save a lot of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">bike shedding</a> time<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>later.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-stay-on-subject">🧐 Stay on<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Subject</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s easy to get distracted and start providing feedback about stuff that’s already running in production. This should be completely<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>avoided.</li>
<li>Open an issue on Jira (you are not an org otherwise 😇) if you want to propose a change in existing<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-allow-deferring-proposed-changes">⏱ Allow Deferring Proposed<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, the proposed changes are quite large and contributors need to meet external<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>deadlines.</li>
<li>The contributors should be allowed to make an issue (on Jira!) for follow-up changes after the current <span class="caps">PR</span> is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>merged.</li>
<li>Alternatively use a <span class="caps">TODO</span> comment with a due date and name tag eg: <strong><span class="caps">TODO</span>(1-<span class="caps">JAN</span>-2020@tusharmath)</strong> inside the codebase. Setup lint rules on the <span class="caps">CI</span> that flags such todo comments when the due date is<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>missed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-leverage-tooling">🛠 Leverage Tooling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tooling is critical in making reviews efficient. Be open to explore paid tools that help in collaborating and reviewing<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>better.</li>
<li>Anything that can be automated should be<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>automated.</li>
<li>Running tools locally as a pre-commit hook, works well for small projects but integrating with <span class="caps">CI</span> is a must for large<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>projects.</li>
<li>Maintain historical data of your builds. Push your code metrics such as build time, artifact size, test coverage, flaky tests, files changed etc. to an external analytics<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>system.</li>
</ul>
