It uses mnemonics to aid you in memorizing words. I went through the <strong>Barrons <span class="caps">GRE</span> List</strong> of words but as I was going through it realized how poor the website was constructed. I wanted to put all these words on one page so that I can search the words quickly using the native browser search plus I wanted it to be available<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>offline.</p>
<p>So I used my <a href="https://github.com/tusharmath/html-scraper">html-scraper</a> to extract all the data and put it into a json file and then created <a href="/articles/mnemonics-dictionary/words.html">this web page</a> out of it. I will later add some more features to improve the performance of the page so that the size of the page<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>reduces.</p>

I though I will share them with everyone in terms of a <strong>Q&amp;A</strong> format. I will cover each chapter one by one but since Chapter 1 and 2 are very basic I have started with chapter three. If I get time I will put questions from Chapter 2 as well. Please note that these are my own notes and it is possible that I might have not explained certain concepts in great detail. In case you have more doubts about a question post it in the comments section or refer to the amazing book for more<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>details.</p>
<p><em>Trust me on this, if you go through these questions diligently one chapter per day then in twenty two days there will be no interview that you can not crack<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>:)</em></p>

Well, the answer is quite simple - To increase download speed.
You could checkout this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmented_file_transfer">wiki</a> to learn more about it or just read on to get a gist if what it<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>does.</p>
<p>What it really does is, it makes multiple connections with the server from where the file has to be downloaded. Now since data is sent in packets on those connections. There is always little bit of a lag between these packets. This especially happens if you have a low speed internet connection or there are multiple applications using the internet at the same<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>time.</p>

Virtual box unfortunately does not provide a support for retina displays (At the time of writing this<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>document).</p>
<p>You will keep trying out different resolutions and will still not be satisfied because sometimes the content would be too stretched in the horizontal direction and sometimes in the vertical direction.

<p>It took a lot of perseverance in getting the recipe just right. So here are some DOs and <span class="caps">DON</span>’Ts for making mutton dum biryani (_same applies for chicken biryani_).
