          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Cricket is a very popular sport here in India. Even though Hockey is our national game, cricket is more followed and idolized. People are so sentimental about cricket that they don’t go to offices, in fact some private companies have half days or sometimes full day off when India is playing. People literally go crazy when India has a match with Pakisthan - a country with whom we have had three wars in the past. I don’t have the exact figures but I am pretty sure that the matches have always militated against India’s <span class="caps">GDP</span> for that particular day&nbsp;:P</p>

<p>So do you really think so? May be, may be not. The thing is that everybody knows the disadvantages of driving at night but no one really pays attention to the advantages of night&nbsp;driving.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>I had a couple roommates back when I was working in <span class="caps">ZS</span> Associates. I had faced a lot issues while calculating shared expenses. Since I always wanted to make sure that we din’t make any mistakes in our calculations I spent some time in creating a Google Doc Spreadsheet for it. It worked fine as it served my purpose and the purpose of some of my friends. The problem was that it was just not the right thing to use if you had more than four people in the group which shared expenses. It looked ugly, would be really slow and any one could tamper the&nbsp;formulas.</p>

These models were designed in MS Excel and could be merged with each other and to create different versions. The application could also render reports on the web and could help in managing access rights in an extremely customised way, based on each user and each client&nbsp;basis.</p>
