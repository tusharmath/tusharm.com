Method chaining is a pretty common pattern in object oriented programming. JQuery does an amazing job at it but its all about sychronous tasks. Then there are promises, they have the `then` method which helps in chaining async requests but its not customizable and also quite verbose. So I created my own project ~ [Chaining Tatum](https://github.com/tusharmath/chaining-tatum) *(No pun intended with the versatile actor [Channing Tatum](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1475594/), big fan!)*
