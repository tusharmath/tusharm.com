I constantly try to make my everyday tasks simpler and more productive, that's why I love developing apps. I have developed a lot of free apps for my myself, family and friends. I have mainly worked on `C#`, `PowerShell`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `CoffeeScript`.  You can see a summary of my projects [here](/projects.html).

In my leisure time I like to learn about physics and cars. I practice swimming and like to be a gourmet from time to time.

*Right now:* Working on server side CoffeeScript. Not having a philosophical conversation.
