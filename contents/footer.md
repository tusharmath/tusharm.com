I constantly try to make my everyday tasks simpler and more productive, that's why I love developing apps. I have developed a lot of free apps for myself, family and friends.  You can see a summary of my projects [here](/projects.html).

In my leisure time I like to learn about physics and cars. I practice swimming and like to be a gourmet from time to time.

*Right now:* I am working on an idea of mine.
