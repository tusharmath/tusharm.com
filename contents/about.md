Hi, I am **Tushar Mathur**. I constantly try to make my everyday tasks simpler and more efficient. Software is something that enables me to do so. I have developed a lot of free apps for my friends and myself. I have mainly worked on `C#`, `PowerShell`, `HTML`, `JavaScript` and `CoffeeScript`.

I like to have philosophical conversations. It works as a stress buster for me. I also like to be a gourmet from time to time.

*About this blog:* This is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. If you want to see a summary the projects that I have been a part of so far, then you should checkout my [projects](/projects.html) page or you can also checkout my cv [here](/files/cv.pdf).

*Right now:* I am working on JavaScript and CoffeeScript extensively, not on the client side so much but the server side using Node.js.
