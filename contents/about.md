Hi, I am **Tushar Mathur**. I enjoy science, swimming and driving at night. I like to be a gourmet from time to time. I constantly try to make my everyday tasks simpler and more productive. Software is something that enables me to do so. I have developed a lot of free apps for my myself and my friends. I have mainly worked on `C#`, `PowerShell`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `CoffeeScript`.

*About this blog:* This is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. If you want to see a summary of the projects that I have been a part of so far, then you should checkout my [cv](/files/cv.pdf) or my [projects](/projects.html) page.

*Right now:* I am working on server side CoffeeScript and am exhausted of having philosophical conversations.
