Hi, I am **Tushar Mathur**. I am the kind of person who constantly tries to make my everyday tasks simpler and software is something that enables me to do so. I have developed a lot of free apps for my friends and myself. I have been working on `C#`, `PowerShell`, `HTML`, `JavaScript`, `CoffeeScript` and some other languages.

I like to have philosophical conversations. It works as a stress buster for me. I also like to be a gourmet from time to time.

*About this blog:* This is not a pure technical blog, this blog is a personal space that I have created for my self. If you want to see a sample of the things that I have done so far, then you should checkout my [projects](/projects.html) page.

*Right now:* I am working on JavaScript and CoffeeScript extensively, not on the client side so much but the server side using Node.js.

Checkout my [cv](/files/cv.pdf) for a gist of things that I have done.
