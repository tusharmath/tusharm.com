I wanted to write this blog about one of my undergrad projects - **Paunkie**. A social networking website which was based on maps. We were a team of two undergrad students who were being mentored by Mrs. Vaishali Dharkar as our project guide. It was inspired by [Serenedipity](https://indigoarchitects.com/CaseStudy/Mobile_Serendipity.aspx), one of [Indigo Architects](http://indigoarchitects.com/) niche products. I was able to convince my partner and our project guide that it was a cool idea and would definitely qualify for a research based project.

The concept of **Paunkie** was to *Geocode you life*. Basically, everything and anything you did or your friends did, could be pinned on to a map and shared within your social network. The best part of the application were the algorithms for generating recommendations in real time.

We just had enough time to prototype the concept and were not able to build a production ready application. Later we realised that no one really is **Production Ready** until they push the code to production :) 

Some time back when I started going through my archives I found a couple of snapshots of our application â€”
