Personally I have always preferred building an offline web app when compared to a native desktop app. I find it lighter, easy to build and easy to update. I wanted to practice the basics of angularjs on a project and wanted to learn more about the best practices that are currently set in the industry today. Thats is why I created this project.

When ever I want to create a new web application that works offline I just fork the repository and get started. All the workflows are pre built in the project, with a single command I can test my app on multiple browsers, package the app, create a HTML5 Application Cache Manifest file and ultimately publish it to GH-Pages.

Here is the links if you want to know more or probably want to use it for your program.
